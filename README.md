## 📌 Task 2 – Implement an AI Agent for Tic-Tac-Toe

This project features an AI-powered version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The AI agent uses the **Minimax algorithm**, optionally enhanced with **Alpha-Beta Pruning**, to play optimally against a human opponent—making it nearly impossible to defeat. This task demonstrates principles of **game theory**, **search algorithms**, and **adversarial decision-making**.
